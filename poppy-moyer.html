Anna, 39, simply wants her children to be out of the spotlight, thus no information concerning Poppy’s education has been released. We can only assume she is currently enrolled in Elementary School.</p><h2>Poppy Moyer Height, Weight</h2><p>Poppy’s mother has claimed that she is a very private person who prefers to keep her personal life out of the public eye. Anna and Stephen have never shared images of the twins or any information about their body measurements. Her height and weight are so unknown to the general public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Poppy-Moye-1.jpg><h2>Career</h2><p>Regarding her career, Poppy is still extremely young, thus she has not begun her career adventure. Poppy is too young to consider her professional future and has plenty of time to decide what she wants to do in the future. Her mother and father, on the other hand, are well-known in the film industry.</p><p>Poppy’s actress mother, Anna Paquin, was just eleven years old when she won the Academy Award for best supporting actress for the film The Piano in 1994.

Stephen’s acting career is still going strong to this day.</p><h2>Poppy Moyer Boyfriend, Relationship</h2><p>Poppy’s personal life is not particularly interesting. She is still too young to be in a romantic relationship, thus she is single. In terms of her parents, Anna and Stephen met on the set of the television series Pilot in 2007 and began dating. They also appeared together on the set of True Blood.</p><p>On August 21, 2010, the couple married in a private house in Malibu, California. On September 12, 2012, she gave birth to twins Charlie and Poppy. Currently, the family is content and shows no signs of tension.</p><p>Stephen has already married twice in their relationship. From his first marriage, he had a son named Billy. Billy is 21 years old as of 2022 and lives in the United Kingdom with his unknown mother.</p><p>Stephan then married Lorien Haynes, a journalist by trade, and had a daughter named Lilac. She will be 19 years old in 2022, having been born in 2002. They divorced after a few years because their relationship did not work out.</p><h2>Poppy Moyer’s Net Worth</h2><p>Poppy is still a child and has yet to generate any income. She is currently reliant on her family. Her father, Stephen Moyer, has a net worth of $10 million as of April 2023, which he has accumulated solely through his acting career.</p><p>Similarly, Poppy’s mother, Anna Paquin, has a staggering $14 million net worth as of December 2023.
