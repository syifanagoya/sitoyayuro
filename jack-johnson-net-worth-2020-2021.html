Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early life</h2><p>Born on May 18, 1975, in Hawaii, US, Jack Johnson is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and a professional athlete. He is the son of legendary surfer Jeff Johnson. As a child, Jack followed his father’s suit and started surfing at the tender age of 5. In fact, he was quite passionate about it and was surfing for 4-5 hours in a day. At that time, his elder brother was a member of a music band, so he also grew interested in music. However, as a child, surfing was the first and foremost for him.</p><p>By the time he completed his high school form a local school, has already become a professional surfer. At the age of 17, he suffered from a surfing accident, and this is when his life was changed completely. Later on, he attended the University of California at Santa Barbara and graduated with a degree in film studies.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>During his college days, Jack also met the love of his life, Kim Johnson. The couple dated for almost 3-4 years before getting married in 2000.

His height is 1.8 m. Tall, and weight is 77 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>As a child, little did Jack knew that he was going to be the rock music star of the country. Initially, he started walking into the footprints of his father and has also impressed the people with his surfing skills. At the age of 17, he created the history after becoming the youngest surfer to reach in the finals of ‘Pipeline Masters,’ Oahu. He missed the title and got severely injured in an accident. That accident turned out to the biggest life-changing point for him. Thereafter, he quit surfing and started focusing on the music. He did his graduation in film studies to learn a bit about the show business. Soon, he started his career as a songwriter when he wrote a couple of songs for the film ‘Thicker than water.’</p><p>For the next two years, he worked for others, and finally, in 2001, he launched his debut album titled ‘Brushfire Fairytales, ’ which was a smash hit and went on achieving the platinum status. After this album, he rose into popularity, and by the end of 2003, he has launched his own recording studio named ‘Brushfire Records.’ Thereafter, he went on giving hits after hits.
