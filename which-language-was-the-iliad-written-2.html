This volume consists of a <b>Greek and Latin edition of</b> the Iliad, followed by two additional poems that narrate the events leading to the Trojan War and the destruction of Troy itself.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-is-the-iliad-written></span>How is the Iliad written?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Iliad was <b>composed as one continuous poem</b>. In its current arrangement (most likely after the establishment of the Alexandrian library in the early 3rd century BC), it is divided into 24 books corresponding to the 24 letters of the Greek alphabet.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=was-the-iliad-originally-written-in-greek></span>Was the Iliad originally written in Greek?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In the modern vulgate (the standard accepted version), the Iliad contains 15,693 lines, divided into 24 books; it is written in <b>Homeric Greek</b>, a literary amalgam of Ionic Greek and other dialects.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=when-was-iliad-and-odyssey-written></span>When was Iliad and Odyssey written?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Iliad and Odyssey are conventionally dated to <b>the late 8th or early 7th century BC</b>. By this time the use of writing was becoming more widespread in Greece and it seems that the poems were also set down for the first time. But it’s clear that the poems contain features preserved from the pre-writing age.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-iliad-written-by></span>Who is Iliad written by?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Homer Iliad/Authors The text is Homer’s “Iliad,” and <b>Homer</b> — if there was such a person — probably wrote it in 762 B.C., give or take 50 years, the researchers found. The “Iliad” tells the story of the Trojan War — if there was such a war — with Greeks battling Trojans.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-audience-was-the-iliad-written-for></span>What audience was the Iliad written for?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In its earliest form, then, the Iliad was likely performed before mostly Greek audiences, but closer to Homer’s time the audience was also <b>Anatolian</b>, most likely with Trojan sympathies.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-the-original-iliad></span>Where is the original Iliad?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Most of these surviving fragments of ancient manuscripts of the Iliad are written on papyrus and were found in <b>Egypt</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-iliad-a-true-story></span>Is Iliad a true story?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Now you’re all caught up. But if you think about the Iliad critically for a couple of seconds, it doesn’t make any real-life sense. … The Iliad isn’t a documentary, and <b>it’s definitely not a memoir</b>, since the actual events that inspired Homer’s story happened hundreds of years before Homer was born.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=in-what-place-and-time-was-iliad-is-written></span>In what place and time was Iliad is written?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Time and place written Unknown, but probably <b>mainland Greece</b>, around 750 b.c.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=when-was-the-iliad-set></span>When was the Iliad set?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Iliad takes place during the Trojan War, which is a legendary conflict between the Greeks and Troy, dated by later Greek authors to <b>the 12th or 13th century BCE</b>. The historical accuracy of the Trojan War is debated, some believing that while Troy may have existed, a war on such a large scale is improbable.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=was-anyone-from-the-iliad-real></span>Was anyone from the Iliad real?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Many of the heroes of The Iliad <b>also appear to be fictional</b>, and there is no record or evidence to suggest Achilles fought there, or that he existed at all.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-killed-helen-of-troy></span>Who killed Helen of Troy?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>queen Polyxo According to a variant of the story, Helen, in widowhood, was driven out by her stepsons and fled to Rhodes, where she was hanged by <b>the Rhodian queen Polyxo</b> in revenge for the death of her husband, Tlepolemus, in the Trojan War.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-the-iliad-easy-to-read></span>Is the Iliad easy to read?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Since the Iliad has been translated into modern English, <b>people often find it surprisingly easy to read</b>. Look for a translation that includes footnotes, a glossary, and other helpful features that may help to make the reading process even easier for you.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-helen-of-troy-a-true-story></span>Is Helen of Troy a true story?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>There are many conflicting elements to the mythology that surround the figure of Helen, some interpretations of the myth even suggest that she was abducted by Paris. But ultimately, <b>there was no real Helen in Ancient Greece</b>, she is purely a mythological character.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-of-troy-is-true></span>How much of Troy is true?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Most historians now agree that ancient Troy was to be <b>found at Hisarlik</b>. Troy was real. Evidence of fire, and the discovery of a small number of arrowheads in the archaeological layer of Hisarlik that corresponds in date to the period of Homer’s Trojan War, may even hint at warfare.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-iliad-and-odyssey-true></span>Is Iliad and Odyssey true?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The network of people in The Iliad, the oldest known work of Western fiction, came out <b>as the most similar to real life</b>. This backed up several archaeological papers that had found evidence that certain events in Homer’s landmark work, such as the Trojan War between Greece and Troy, actually happened in ancient times.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=was-achilles-a-spartan-or-trojan></span>Was Achilles A Spartan or Trojan?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In Greek mythology, Achilles was the <b>strongest warrior and hero</b> in the Greek army during the Trojan War. He was the son of Peleus, king of the Myrmidons, and Thetis, a sea nymph. The story of Achilles appears in Homer’s Iliad and elsewhere.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-odysseus-real></span>Is Odysseus real?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Archaeologists believe they have found the palace of Odysseus, the legendary Greek king of Ithaca and hero of Homer’s epic poem. They believe that the 8th BC century palace which they have discovered in Ithaca, in the Ionian Seas west of mainland Greece, proves that <b>he was a real historical figure</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-race-is-helen-troy></span>What race is Helen Troy?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>forget that ancient troy is situated in what is modern-day turkey. forget for a hot minute that ancient troy is situated in olive-skinned, middle-east-proximate turkey. helen of troy, most beautiful woman in all of history, was <b>white</b>, because helen of troy was diane kruger, elizabeth taylor, sienna guillory.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-was-the-ugliest-god></span>Who was the ugliest god?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Facts <b>about Hephaestus</b><p>Hephaestus was the only ugly god among perfectly beautiful immortals. Hephaestus was born deformed and was cast out of heaven by one or both of his parents when they noticed that he was imperfect. He was the workman of the immortals: he made their dwellings, furnishings, and weapons.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-killed-agamemnon></span>Who killed Agamemnon?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Clytemnestra <b>Clytemnestra</b>, in Greek legend, a daughter of Leda and Tyndareus and wife of Agamemnon, commander of the Greek forces in the Trojan War. She took Aegisthus as her lover while Agamemnon was away at war. Upon his return, Clytemnestra and Aegisthus murdered Agamemnon.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46wn6KbmGK5orrGrpignV2srrR506GcZqGcnq6ledaroK2slaN6c3s%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./best-wolf-pokemon-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 best wolf Pokmon, ranked">&larr;
