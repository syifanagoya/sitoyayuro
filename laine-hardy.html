Hardy is the winner of American Idol of season <i>17</i>. <a href=#><strong>Kelly Clarkson</strong></a> also rose to fame after winning the first season of <i>American Idol (first season)</i>. Despite being so young, Laine still manages to win the heart of Million of people around the world.</p><p>Laine's mother,<strong> Cindy Luo</strong> is a real estate agent, and her father,<strong> Barry Luo</strong> is a general contractor for a construction company. Laine attended <i>French Settlement High School </i>and later graduated in <i>2018 </i>from the same organization. Having a keen interest in music from a young age, he used to play in a band with his cousins and brother.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, the talented singer Laine was born in <i>Baton Rouge, Louisiana</i> on <i>12th September 2000</i>. As of now, he is struggling hard and more success is waiting for him in the near future.</p><h2>Does Laine Hardy Have A Girlfriend?</h2><p>Sweet and charming Laine is one of the people's favorite singers on American Idol. Lots of women are falling for him due to his great personality and singing style. But he has not revealed his present relationship status towards the media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/3/6/Webp.net-resizeimage-1583484757065.jpg><p>However, it is reported that Laine is in a romantic relationship with his longtime friend, <strong>Gracie Lee</strong> to be the love of his life. Two are known to be dating for over a year and were college sweethearts.&nbsp;</p><p>Hardy has shared pictures with Lee on his Facebook account. Back on <i>January 10, 2020</i>, he shared a picture with Gracie on the occasion of her birthday captioning,&nbsp;</p><p>"I just want to come and say happy birthday to this amazing girl, sheâ€™s tough as nails and has helped me through so much. I love you & I hope you have an amazing day."</p><p>But neither Laine nor Gracie has clearly revealed their relationship status. Besides Gracie, Laine also shares a close bond with other girls so it hard to say whether they are dating or are just a good friend.&nbsp;</p><h2>Past Affairs and Relationship&nbsp;</h2><p>It is also known that a singer Laine was previously romantically linked with a girl named, <strong>Sydney Becnel. </strong>The two dated each other for the past few years and loves to hang out with one another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/3/6/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(4)-1583484765812.jpg><p>Sydney even supported Laine in each and every part of the American Idol journey. Not only the couple were happy but both of the duos were happy with their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>The whole family used to have dinner together and loves to have fun. However, their relationship ended up in the blink of an eye. Though none party has confirmed their split they are still known to be good friends.</p><h2>Is Laine Linked With Sydney Taylor</h2><p>The<i> 20-years-old </i>Laine's love life details is quite complicated. His exact relationship status is still unclear. At the moment, there is rumors swirling all over the media that Hardy is romantically connected with <strong>Sydney Taylor</strong>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/2/8/tay-1612792720053.JPG><p>Sydeny is the winner of the<i> </i>beauty pagent<i>, 2020 Miss Louisiana Teen USA</i>. The rumors regarding Taylor and Hardy's romantic affair arise after she shared a picture with him on her social sites.&nbsp;</p><p>On<i> July 26, 2020</i>, Sudney shared a picture of herself alongside Laine writing, <i>"Thankin God for this 1." </i>However, Taylor and Hardy has not officially disclosed their relationship status. The two might be sharing a healthy bond as a perfect friend. So, we cannot claim them as a lovebird.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>The American singer, Hardy has an estimated net worth of <strong>$400,000</strong> which hasn't been officially confirmed yet. But being one of the most popular young idols his fortune surely falls in very good number without a doubt. Besides he is the winner of <i>American Idol</i> season <i>17</i> from which he surely has bagged a big amount of paycheque and record deal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/3/6/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(3)-1583484778719.jpg><p>American Idol season six winner, <strong>Maddie Poppe</strong> received a <strong>$250,000</strong> cash prize and contract with Hollywood Records. However, Hardy's winning prize hasn't been yet revealed but it surely ranges in a similar amount. As of now, he is still busy in making new songs and touring various places around the state with his bandmate.&nbsp;</p><h2>Journey to the American idol</h2><p>It was not the first time American Idol has seen him performing live. His first audition was in season 16 of American Idol but he ended up only making up to the top 50. It leads him to practice more and harder to achieve huge success.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/3/6/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(2)-1583484790317.jpg><p>Interestingly on season <i>17</i>, he accompanies his friend at her audition by playing the guitar and later was encouraged by judges, <a href=#><strong>Lionel Richie</strong></a>, <strong>Luke Bryan,</strong> and <strong>Katy Perry </strong>to audition again. Which ended up him winning the title of American Idol season 17 by making Alejandro Aranda runner up and Madison Vandenburg's second runner up.&nbsp;</p><p>After winning the title he launched his three-song EP, In the Bayou. On <i>20th September 2019</i>, Laine announced his first headline tour which later ended up on <i>7th December 2019</i>.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Stay connected to </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>married celeb</strong></i></a><i><strong> for more biographies and gossips</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqWYoqaVYrWivsOy</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gzhgvipwjmt2ae5gggaeaj-wlnijuixv.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch Hey Arnold!
