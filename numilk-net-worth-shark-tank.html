Effectively, this puts their valuation of Numilk at $20 million.</p><p>Remember how the company raised $12 million from angel investors?</p><p>As it turned out, this didn’t generate the kind of profits anyone had expected.</p><p>In 2018, Numilk generated slightly over $40k in sales.</p><p>The following year, it generated an impressive $320k in sales.</p><p>And in 2020, it generated $400k in sales. However, over the three financial periods, the company lost $7 million—predominantly do high research and development expenses.</p><p>While the rest of the Sharks’ panel was out, Mark Cuban had an offer the boys couldn’t refuse: $2 million.</p><p>$1 million would be for a 7% stake in the company, and $1 million would be a loan at 3% interest + an additional 3% equity or advisory shares.</p><p>Effectively, if the pair didn’t take the loan, it was $1 million for 7% equity.</p><p>If they took the loan, it was $2 million for 10% equity.</p><p>The deal was accepted.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Kesha Beachy Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Numilk – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>So, how much is Numilk worth?</p><p>Numilk entered into negotiations with upmarket supermarket chain Whole Foods in 2021, and also launched a Kickstarter campaign.</p><p>The campaign raised an additional $220,000.</p><p>Numilk’s kiosks are used at 65 stores across the United States, with their commercial countertop machines in use at an estimated 150 coffee shops and cafes.</p><p>The company also reached an agreement with Hamilton Beach to manufacture their Home and Pro machines in September of 2022.</p><p>Their home countertop machines have not yet been released to the public, but are available for pre-order through the company’s official website and marketed as a One Press Wonder.</p><p>In 2023, Numilk and Hamilton Beach Brands entered a multiyear agreement.</p><p>Therefore, Numilk has an estimated net worth of $25 million.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>Who is Mario Kiezi’s wife</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfo8KutcukZKedpGLEsL7ToWSsoJGnuG7AwKeiaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lenny-kravitz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lenny Kravitz - Biography | HELLO!">&larr;
