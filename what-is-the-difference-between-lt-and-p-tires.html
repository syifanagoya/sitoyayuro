They can be used to travel short as well as long distances. On-road vehicles make our purpose fast and hassle-free.</p><p>Tires are ring-shaped rubber components that surround a wheel’s rim. They are made to transfer the load of the vehicle from the axel, through the wheel and finally to the group for the required traction. This allows for the movement of the vehicle.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lt-vs-p-tires></span><strong>LT vs P Tires</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>The main difference between light truck tires and passenger tires is in their load range, where LT tires have a load range of 10 plies, passenger tires only have a load range of 4 plies. This points to the fact that LT tires are more strong and durable than passenger tires.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>LT tires are bigger in size than P tires and also have higher air pressure than the latter. To set light truck tires and passenger tires apart, ‘LT’ and ‘P’ are placed in front of tires of different sizes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=comparison-table-between-lt-and-p-tires></span><strong>Comparison Table Between LT and P Tires</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-lt-tires></span><strong>What are LT Tires?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Light Truck tires can carry heavy loads, tow other vehicles and have off-roading durability. These tires are specially designed to work efficiently under extreme conditions and doing it while carrying a heavy weight. The high amount of inflation and the air pressure inside the tires ensure that they are capable to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>It is the air inside the tires that enables them to carry the load of the vehicle. Light truck tires have more area inside them that can be filled with air which increases its load capacity. They have deep tread depths and have better off-roading capabilities. They also have heavy construction of sidewall and the shoulder region.</p><p>When the LT tires are to be changed in a vehicle, they should always be replaced with LT tires. If they are replaced with P tires, one should make sure that they have an adequate load carrying capacity. Due to the LT tires’ toughness, they are also much safer than P tires.</p>Travelstar Ecopath AT LT245/75R16 120/116S E Rated 10 Ply All Terrain (A/T) SUV & Light Truck Tire (Tire Only)<ul><li>Tire Only – Rim Not Included</li><li>Tire Size: LT245/75R16</li><li>Load Range: E (10 Ply)</li></ul>Check Price on Amazon<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-p-tires></span><strong>What are P Tires?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Passenger tires are also known as P tires. These kinds of tires are used in SUVs and other lighter vehicles. Passenger tires were originally designed for cars and station-wagons. Nowadays, they are also used for pickup trucks, vans and other vehicles.</p><p>Passenger tires, as the name suggests, are intended for the purpose of carrying passengers (people) instead of cargo. The tires are light in weight, have a low resistance to rolling and less compact tread designs. Their design is more suitable for normal terrains and they cannot be relied on for off-roading.</p><p>P tires are designed for human comfort and it shows in their driving. The tires also provide better fuel economy and expel less noise. The same cannot be said for light truck tires. The passenger tires are made for smooth and paved roads and should be used for the same, in case they aren’t there are more chances of them being worn out sooner rather than later.</p>Pirelli P ZERO Nero All-Season Tire – 255/35R18 94H<ul><li>High-performance all-season tires for sporty coupes and sedans</li><li>Variable angle grooves for higher mechanical grip</li><li>Innovative all season compound for top level grip on wet and dry conditions</li></ul>Check Price on Amazon<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=main-differences-between-lt-and-p-tires></span><strong>Main Differences Between LT and P Tires</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><li>LT tires are used in light trucks while P tires are used in passenger vehicles.</li><li>Light truck tires are heavier and rougher than passenger tires.</li><li>Passenger tires are less inflated in comparison to LT tires.</li><li>Passenger tires are seen in cars, bikes, etc and are more flexible than light truck tires.</li><li>As light truck tires perform a heavy-duty task of moving heavier vehicles, they are more durable and stiff than passenger tires.</li><li>LT tires have a load range of 10 plies as opposed to P tires that have a load range of 4 play.</li><li>LT tires are made for rough terrains like mountains, rocky roads, etc while P tires are made for smooth terrains.&nbsp;</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=conclusion></span><strong>Conclusion</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tires are a very important part of vehicles and without them, transport would be impossible. They support the vehicle and help them move. Light truck tires and passenger tires are durable and tough to different extents and are used in different vehicles. Both types of tires are flexible and adequately inflated.</p><p>LT tires are specially designed for heavier vehicles that carry cargo while P tires are designed for passenger vehicles. These tires should be used for their specific purposes and not interchanged. Light truck tires should only be replaced by light truck tires and passenger tires should only be replaced by passenger tires. If interchanged, they will not give the same output and will be worn out.</p><p>The tires are built with great detail and attention to specific vehicle needs. This makes them perfect for the purpose they are designed for. The tires are reliable, strong, durable and able to hold their qualities even after a long time. They endure even during rough and harsh conditions.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=references></span><strong>References</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><li>https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2003-01-1272/</li><li>https://meridian.allenpress.com/tst/article-abstract/39/2/125/187130</li><li>https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/670174/&nbsp;</li><p class=aawp-disclaimer>Last update on 2022-02-08 / Amazon Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDx5qrZqGjZMSprdNmoKxlpJ2ybrDIn52eqpWjsKZ5wZ6rsJ2Vo3qtwIyapZ1loGLBqr7ErGY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./suzanne-denise-benoit-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Suzanne Denise Benoit Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;
